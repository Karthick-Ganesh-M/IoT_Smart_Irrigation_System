                                üå± SMART IoT-BASED IRRIGATION SYSTEM
                              
The Smart IoT-Based Irrigation System is an intelligent solution designed to automate the irrigation process using real-time environmental and soil data. By leveraging a network of sensors and IoT modules, the system ensures efficient water usage and helps maintain optimal soil conditions for plant growth.
The core objective of this project is to reduce manual intervention in farming, minimize water wastage, and provide real-time updates to the user through GSM communication and GPS tracking. The system continuously Monitors parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and nutrient content (NPK levels), and automatically activates a water pump when the soil moisture falls below a defined threshold.
This project demonstrates the integration of hardware sensors with microcontroller logic, cloudless communication, and location tracking ‚Äî making it a practical, scalable, and eco-friendly solution for smart agriculture.

   Component           	         Function
   
1) DHT11                  Sensor	Measures ambient temperature and humidity in the environment.
2) Soil Moisture Sensor	 Detects the moisture level in the soil to determine when watering is required.
3) NPK Sensor	           Measures the levels of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in the soil to monitor soil fertility.
4) Water Pump	           Automatically turns ON/OFF based on the soil moisture readings.
5) GSM Module (SIM800L)	 Sends SMS alerts to the farmer regarding soil condition and irrigation status.
6) GPS Module	           Sends the geographic location of the field for real-time monitoring.
7) Microcontroller       	Controls all the sensors, makes decisions based on sensor data, and automates the pump.
